# Dreamweaver Prototype

## Description
Welcome to the Dreamweaver Prototype! This prototype offers a glimpse into the unique gameplay experience envisioned for the full game. In this early version, players navigate through two distinct levels, each presenting its own set of challenges and mechanics.

## Level 1: Dream Realm
In the dream realm, players must navigate through a surreal landscape while dodging enemies known as "nightmares." These adversaries represent suppressed emotions and obstacles from the protagonist's subconscious. Use your reflexes and agility to evade the nightmares and progress towards the end goal – a yellow circle marking the exit.

## Level 2: Wakeful World
Transitioning to the wakeful world, players face a new set of challenges in the form of platforming obstacles. Traverse through intricate levels filled with platforms, obstacles, and pitfalls. Your task remains the same – reach the yellow circle at the end of the level to proceed.

## Game Mechanics
- Movement: Use A and D to move the protagonist.
- Jumping: Press the Spacebar to jump over obstacles and enemies.
- Collectibles: Look out for life pods scattered throughout the levels. Collecting a life pod grants you an additional life, while colliding with an enemy deducts a life.
- Objective: Reach the yellow circle at the end of each level to progress.
